# About Me

Hi! I'm **Thibault**, an engineer passionate about technology and automation. 

On my GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects ranging from small Raspberry Pi projects to full bare-metal deployments, and even monitoring solutions. 

I enjoy experimenting with different tools and technologies, so youâ€™ll see a wide range of work here, suitable for various use cases and interests.

## TibHome Organization

I also have an organization called **TibHome**, where I share tools and scripts specifically designed for personal homelabs.

These tools help with everything from monitoring to automation and much more. You can explore the full collection [TibHome](https://github.com/TibHome).

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to the projects!
